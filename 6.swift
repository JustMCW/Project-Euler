/*
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

    1^2 + 2^2+...+ 10^2 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

    (1+2+...+10)^2= 55^2 =3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 
3025âˆ’385=2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
